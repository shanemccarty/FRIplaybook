## Required

Your *R&D Report*, *Team R&D Manuscript*, *Final Report*, and *Final Manuscript* will include headings based on the checklist and backticks for variables, such as `EFFICACY`.

:::

## Markdown

You will write in the English language with [markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) language to format your quarto report.

```{markdown}
This is a language called markdown. It is very simple. You can use
*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics*** to produce:
```

-   *italics*
-   **bold**
-   ***bold italics***

## Headings

Use markdown syntax to create headings based on the checkklist for your report. 

```{markdown}
# Introduction
## Significance
## Knowns and Unknowns
## Research Aims

# Methods
## IRB Approval
## TBD ... 

# Results

# Discussion

# References

```



## Using Lists

```{markdown}
**Research Questions:**

1. Does the intervention improve health literacy scores?
2. Do effects differ by demographic group?
3. Are improvements sustained at 3-month follow-up?

```


```{markdown}
**Hypotheses:**

1. **H1**: Participants in the intervention group will show higher health literacy scores than controls.
2. **H2**: Effects will be moderated by baseline education level.

```

### Inline Math

```{markdown}
### Inline Math
- Greek letters: $\alpha = 0.05$, $\beta$ coefficient
- Equations: $t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}$
```


### Naming Variables

You can use a backtick to denote code or the name of a variable by placing a word within \`\`. For example, if I put EFFICACY between \`\` then it returns `EFFICACY` . This will be important for naming variables in your report.

::: callout-important
## Requirement

Use \` \` between CAPITALIZED variable names in your report if you are referring to the measured variable. The use of backticks is NOT appropriate in your introduction and discussion sections, but backticks should be used in your methods and results sections.
