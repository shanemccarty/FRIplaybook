abstract: |
  This chapter introduces students to the ggplot2 package, a powerful tool for creating sophisticated and publication-ready data visualizations in R. Students learn the foundational "grammar of graphics" approach, which builds plots layer by layer using seven core components: data, mapping, geometries, facets, statistics, coordinates, and  themes. Through hands-on examples using insurance data, the chapter demonstrates how to construct various plot types including scatterplots, bar plots, and violin plots. 
  Students explore how to visualize relationships between variables, incorporate grouping variables using color and faceting, and customize plots with titles, labels, and themes. By the end of this chapter, students will understand how to select appropriate visualizations based on data types and create professional-quality figures for their public health research.

## Required

Your *R&D Report* and *R&D Team Manuscript* should include [ggsave( )](#save) information so you can export your plots quickly and add them to the poster.
:::

## Load Library

To install and load ggplot2:

```{r}
#| label: install packages
#| eval: false
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Example Dataset: Insurance Charges

Let's start by loading our dataset and exploring it:

```{r}
#| label: import-data-insurance
insurance <- read.csv("data/insurance.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: load-library-ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
```

### Summarizing Our Data

Let's learn more about our data with `summary()`:

```{r}
#| label: summarize-variables
summary(insurance)
```

```{r}
#| label: review-header
head(insurance, 10)
```

## The Seven Components of ggplot2

Think of building a ggplot like making a layered lasagna - you add one component at a time to create the final product.

![*In ggplot2, add layers as you would in making lasagna*](images/ggplot2-lasagna.png)

The seven components are:

1.  **Data**: The dataset you're visualizing

2.  **Mapping**: Which variables go on which axes (aesthetics)

3.  **Geometries**: The type of plot (points, lines, bars, etc.)

4.  **Facets**: Subplots based on categorical variables

5.  **Statistics**: Statistical transformations of the data

6.  **Coordinates**: The coordinate system (usually Cartesian)

7.  **Theme**: Visual styling and appearance

[![source: \[ggplot2.tidyverse.org\](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html)](images/ggplot2-layers.png){fig-alt="the image includes 7 colors for each of the 7 layers"}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html)

## Understanding Data Types

Before creating visualizations, it's important to understand your data types:

**Qualitative Data:**

-   🏷️ **Nominal Data**: Categories without any order (e.g., Red, Green, Blue)

-   📶 **Ordinal Data**: Categories with some order (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)

**Quantitative Data:**

-   🔢 **Discrete**: Countable data (e.g., number of people in a room)

-   📏 **Continuous**: Measurable data (e.g., height, weight)

## Decision Tree

Your research question can be classified as **comparative** research or **relationship** research ([Barroga & Matanguihan, 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35470596/)).

![*The decision tree helps researchers to identify the specific statistical technique based on their comparative or relationship research question*](images/ggplot2-decision.png)

### Relationship Research 

For relationship research, the variables are continuous. The example below shows how to build a scatterplot step by step.

#### Step 1: Data and Mapping

What is the relationship between BMI and insurance charges?

```{r}
ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges))
```

This creates a blank canvas with our axes defined, but no data displayed yet!

#### Step 2: Adding Layers with Geometries

Add points to create a scatterplot using `geom_point()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) + 
  geom_point()
```

#### Step 3: Adding a Trend Line

Add a linear model line with `geom_smooth()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Notice how it looks like we have two different populations? Let's explore this further.

#### Optional – Step 4. Incorporating Grouping Variables

There are two main approaches to visualizing grouping variables:

##### Method 1: Using Color

Map the `smoker` variable to color:

```{r}
ggplot(data = insurance, 
       mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

##### Method 2: Using Facets

Create separate panels for each group with `facet_wrap()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~smoker)
```

Both methods reveal that smoking status significantly affects the relationship between BMI and insurance charges!

#### Step 5. Custom Theme and Colors

##### Adding Titles and Labels

Make your plot more informative with descriptive titles:

```{r}
ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Insurance charges vs BMI for smokers and non-smokers") +
  xlab("Body Mass Index (BMI)") +
  ylab("Insurance Charges")
```

##### Changing the Theme

Apply a professional theme with `theme_bw()`:

```{r}
#| label: ggplot with black and white theme 
#| fig-cap: "a scatterplot depicting a linear relationship between BMI and insurance charges"
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 8

ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Insurance charges vs BMI for smokers and non-smokers") +
  xlab("Body Mass Index (BMI)") +
  ylab("Insurance Charges") +
  theme_bw()
```

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
## Select a theme

Team members should pick **one theme** (from the [complete themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)) to use with all plots in the individual reports and the team manuscript!

## `ggsave()` using Common Plot Types {#save}

[ggsave( )](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html) is a specific function to save a plot as an image in .jpg or .png image. This plot is saved in the "files" folder, which can be exported out of Posit Cloud and into your poster.

::: callout-important
## Requirement

You must use file for both your final report and team manuscript.

Your *R&D Report*, *Team R&D Manuscript*, *Final Report*, and *Final Manuscript* must include `ggsave( )` for plots.
:::

### Bar Plots with `geom_bar()`

Bar plots are useful for comparing means across categories:

```{r}
#| label: plot-region-charges 
#| fig-cap: "a scatterplot depicting a linear relationship between BMI and insurance charges"
#| fig-alt: the figure 
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 8

plot_region_charges <- ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = region, y = charges)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'summary', fun = 'mean', fill = "#005a43") + 
  ggtitle("Mean Insurance Charges Based on Region") + 
  xlab("Region") +
  ylab("Insurance Charges") +
  theme_bw()

# Print and save the plot
print(plot_region_charges)
ggsave("plots/plot1:region.png", 
       plot = plot_region_charges, 
       width = 10, 
       height = 8, 
       dpi = 300)
```

After you run the code, the console will ask you a question. The use of `plots/` in the `ggsave()` code chunk will create a folder called **Plots** in your files within Posit Cloud if you type "1" and click return/enter.

![](images/ggplot2-ggsave.png){fig-alt="a screenshot of the console output after running the ggsave code"}

In your **Files**, click the **Plots** folder. Your location within Posit Cloud is shown below: Cloud \> project \> plots. You are in the **Plots**.

![](images/ggplot2-ggsave-plotsfolder.png){fig-alt="this is a screenshot of the files within the plot folder of posit cloud"}

Click the gear icon (above " project \> plots"), click export, and **Download.** Then, upload this the plot and others within your team's google drive \> Team Survey Data \> Quant Data \> Plots.

### Violin Plots with `geom_violin()`

Violin plots show the distribution of data across categories:

```{r}
#| label: plot-smoker-charges 
#| fig-cap: "a violin plot depicting differences in insurance charges based on smoker status"
#| fig-alt: the figure 
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 8


ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = smoker, y = charges, fill = smoker)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Insurance Charges by Smoking Status") +
  xlab("Smoker (Y/N)") +
  ylab("Insurance Charges") +
  theme_bw()

#plot above plot without using plot = argument
ggsave("plots/plot2:smoker.png", width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 300)
```
