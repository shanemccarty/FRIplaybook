Students in the FRI Public Health research stream at Binghamton University explore a variety of biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health. This playbook includes a variety of "plays" (R code) that students in the quantitative data analysis track can use for their team-based research projects.

The most successful sports teams rely on well-designed plays to navigate complex game situations. The FRI Public Health research stream uses strategic data analysis "plays" to tackle the multifaceted challenges of promoting wellbeing, preventing disease, and protecting health. Our research stream explores the intricate biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health by collecting physiological data through wearables like MUSE S and Fitbits, psychological insights via survey questionnaires and interviews, and behavioral patterns through online experiments. Like a coach calling the right play at the crucial moment, this playbook equips you and your research teams with proven strategies for importing, tidying, transforming, visualizing, modeling, and communicating the mixed-methods data that helps us connect the dots between social, political, commercial, and economic determinants of health behavior, outcomes, and inequities. Each "play" in this guide has been field-tested by research teams who have successfully used quantitative and qualitative approaches to answer pressing questions about physical and mental health. Whether you're facing a complex dataset for the first time or looking to refine your analytical strategy, this playbook offers guidance for you to turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom in order to improve public health outcomes.
