Replication or reproducibility crisis

:   growing concern about the inability to reproduce published scientific research findings

A *Nature* paper by [Baker (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) states: "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments."

The failure to reproduce research is a function of systems pressure (defunding of public higher education), *intentional actions* (fraudulent scientific practices), *unintentional* *decision-making* (e.g., human error when clicking software, poor note-taking), and *scientific* *training* (e.g., methodology sections without clear protocols and details). Reproducible research is both an intentional practice and the outcome of scientific training emphasizing a specific workflow.

A primary objective of this playbook is to increase the reproducibility of public health research using line-by-line coding in R with Quarto for publishing the research with code chunks to confirm accuracy.

## Reproducible Reports

You and your team will produce a reproducible Quarto Markdown report (`.qmd`) for your individual report and team manuscript. Specific instructions are provided in the next chapter.

Quarto provided two examples of a reproducible report and manuscript:

-   [Standard Quarto Report Example](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-gallery/page-layout/tufte.html)

-   [Standard Quarto Manuscript Example](https://quarto-ext.github.io/manuscript-template-jupyter/)

The FRI Public Health Lab has produced Quarto manuscripts from active research projects:

-   [Health Avoiders Report](https://zihanhei.quarto.pub/avoider-report/)

-   [Zero Sum Full Report](https://fripublichealth.quarto.pub/zerosum/)

-   [Zero Sum Mini Report](https://fripublichealth.quarto.pub/zerosum/example-preview.html)
