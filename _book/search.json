    "text": "Preface\nThe most successful sports teams rely on well-designed plays to navigate complex game situations, the FRI Public Health research stream uses strategic data analysis “plays” to tackle the multifaceted challenges of promoting wellbeing, preventing disease, and protecting health. Our research stream explores the intricate biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health by collecting physiological data through wearables like MUSE S and Fitbits, psychological insights via survey questionnaires and interviews, and behavioral patterns through online experiments. Like a coach calling the right play at the crucial moment, this playbook equips you and your research teams with proven strategies for importing, tidying, transforming, visualizing, modeling, and communicating the mixed-methods data that helps us connect the dots between social, political, commercial, and economic determinants of health behavior, outcomes, and inequities. Each “play” in this guide has been field-tested by research teams who have successfully used quantitative and qualitative approaches to answer pressing questions about physical and mental health. Whether you’re facing a complex dataset for the first time or looking to refine your analytical strategy, this playbook offers guidance for you to turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom in order to improve public health outcomes.\nTo learn more about the FRI Public Health stream, visit us at: https://fripublichealth.quarto.pub.",

    "text": "5.2 Example 1: Recoding Education into Categories\nWhen working with survey data, we often need to collapse detailed response categories into broader groups. This is useful for:\n\nSimplifying analysis\nCreating groups with adequate sample sizes\nMaking results easier to interpret\n\n\n5.2.1 Original Education Variable\nOur survey asked about education level with 7 response options:\n\nLess than high school\nHigh school diploma or GED\nSome college, but no degree\nAssociate’s or technical degree\nBachelor’s degree\nMaster’s degree\nDoctoral or professional degree\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Recoding into Three Categories\nLet’s group these into three meaningful categories:\n\n# Create a new 3-category education variable\nalldata &lt;- alldata %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    education_3cat = factor(\n      case_when(\n        Education_Level %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4) ~ \"Less than Bachelor's\",\n        Education_Level == 5 ~ \"Bachelor's Degree\",\n        Education_Level %in% c(6, 7) ~ \"Graduate Degree\"\n      ),\n      levels = c(\"Less than Bachelor's\", \"Bachelor's Degree\", \"Graduate Degree\")\n    )\n  )\n\n# Check the recoding with a cross-tabulation\ntable(alldata$Education_Level, alldata$education_3cat, useNA = \"ifany\")\n\n   \n    Less than Bachelor's Bachelor's Degree Graduate Degree\n  1                   11                 0               0\n  2                   17                 0               0\n  3                    8                 0               0",
