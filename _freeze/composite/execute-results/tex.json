Students learn to check whether items on a scale reliably measure the same construct using Cronbach's alpha, and then calculate an average score across all items. The chapter uses a straightforward approach where composite scores are only calculated for participants who answered all items on the scale, ensuring everyone's score has the same meaning. Through a practical example with sleep behavior data, students learn the essential steps: select items, check reliability, remove incomplete cases, and calculate mean scores. This skill is fundamental when working with validated scales in public health surveys.\nkeywords:\n  - composite scores\n  - Cronbach's alpha\n  - reliability\n  - survey scales\nformat: html\neditor: visual\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## ðŸ“– Additional Learning Resources\n\n- **Cheat Sheet**: [dplyr Data Transformation](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf)\n- **psych Package**: [Quick reference guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/psych.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n",
