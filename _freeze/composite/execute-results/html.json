Using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire \n  (Higgins, 2001) as an example, researchers learn to measure promotion focus \n  (preference for growth) and prevention focus (preference for maintaining status quo) \n  through a systematic four-step process: (1) define which survey items belong to \n  each construct, (2) identify and reverse-code negatively worded items, (3) calculate \n  composite scores by averaging items using the psych package's scoreItems() function, \n  and (4) assess scale reliability using Cronbach's alpha. The chapter explains why \n  single items are insufficient for measuring psychological constructs and demonstrates \n  how multiple items averaged together create more reliable continuous measures. \n  Researchers learn to interpret Cronbach's alpha values (with acceptable reliability \n  typically above .70) and understand when reverse coding is necessary for items that \n  capture the absence rather than presence of a construct. Through practical examples \n  with health beliefs data, researchers master creating composite scores that accurately \n  reflect theoretical constructs while handling missing data and ensuring all \n  participants' scores have equivalent meaning. This skill is essential when working \n  with validated multi-item scales in public health and behavioral research.\nkeywords:\n  - composite scores\n  - Cronbach's alpha\n  - reliability\n  - survey scales\nformat: html\neditor: visual\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n::: callout-tip\n## ðŸ“– `psych` resources\n\n-   [Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/psych.pdf)\n-   [Personality Project in R](https://personality-project.org/r/psych/)\n-   [Reliability](https://rpubs.com/deondb/reliability)\n-   [Reliability Analysis](https://rpubs.com/hauselin/reliabilityanalysis)\n:::\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe health beliefs dataset includes a range of variables, including promotion focus and prevention focus.\n\n-   Promotion focus: a general regulatory motivational preference toward growth and change, attention to positive things, and success seeking\n\n-   Prevention focus: a general regulatory motivational preference toward maintaining the status quo, avoiding negative things, and aversion to threats\n\n### Load Library\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Import\n\n\n::: {.cell autorun='true' completion='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import Excel file\nhealthbeliefsdata <- read_excel(\"data/03.15.2025.prolifichealthbeliefs.xlsx\",\n    col_names = TRUE)\n\nhealthbeliefsdata[healthbeliefsdata == -99] <- NA\nhealthbeliefsdata[healthbeliefsdata == -50] <- NA\n\n##explanation: all -99 and -50 data will be treated as missing data\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Scoring Key to Create Composites\n\nIn psychology, researchers aim to measure a construct using multiple items. For example, promotion focus (`PROMOFOCUS`) and prevention focus (`PREVFOCUS`) are two separate measures with 6 items and 5 items, respectively. To create a composite measure, each item is added and divided by the number of items, resulting in an average score for the measure.\n\n-   `PROMOFOCUS`: ( `FOCUS_1` + `FOCUS_2` + `FOCUS_3` + `FOCUS_4` + `FOCUS_5` + `FOCUS_6` ) / 6\n-   `PREVFOCUS`: ( `FOCUS_7` + `FOCUS_8` + `FOCUS_9` + `FOCUS_10` + `FOCUS_11` ) / 5\n\nNo single item is perfectly predictive of a construct. In rare cases, a single item can approximate a construct, such as the single item self-esteem scale (Robbins et al., 2001) for self esteem and the single item life satisfaction measure. In most cases, a single item is highly problematic. For this reason (and to create a continuous -- not ordinal), multiple items are averaged to create a **composite score**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(psych)\n# Create keys for scoring\nfocus_keys <- list(\n  PROMOFOCUS = c(\"FOCUS_1\", \"FOCUS_2\", \"FOCUS_3\", \"FOCUS_4\", \"FOCUS_5\", \"FOCUS_6\"),\n  PREVFOCUS = c(\"FOCUS_7\", \"FOCUS_8\", \"FOCUS_9\", \"FOCUS_10\", \"FOCUS_11\") \n)\n\n#explanation: this creates a list called focus_keys which tells R which survey questions belong to which composite score (promotion or prevention)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## What is focus_keys?\n\n-   Items 1-6 measure promotion focus (`PROMOFOCUS)`\n-   Items 7-11 measure prevention focus (`PREVFOCUS)`\n:::\n\n### Scoring Key with Reverse Items\n\n#### Affirmative Items\n\nBelow are two examples of FOCUS items:\n\n-   Promotion Item (`FOCUS_3`): \"How often have you accomplished things that got you \"psyched\" to work even harder?\"\n\n-   Prevention Item (`FOCUS_9`): \"How often did you obey rules and regulations that were established by your parents?\"\n\nThese items were measured on a 5-point scale:\n\n-   Never or Seldom (1)\n-   Rarely (2)\n-   Sometimes (3)\n-   Often (4)\n-   Very often (5)\n\n#### Negative Items (aka Reverse-Coded Items)\n\n-   Promotion Item (`FOCUS_6`): \"I have found very few hobbies or activities in my life that capture my interest or motivate me to put effort into them.\"\n-   Prevention Item (`FOCUS_8`): \"Did you get on your parentsâ€™ nerves often when you were growing up?\"\n\nMost often, a construct is measured with **affirmative items** where the most agreement/occurrence (very often) is coded as a 5 on a 1-5 scale. Sometimes, a construct also includes negative items where the strongest agreement (very often) to a **negative item** is coded as 1 on a 1-5 scale. In essence, for reverse-scored items, the coded values are flipped.\n\nNotice how the phrase \"**very few\"** in the item -- \"I have found **very few** hobbies or activities in my life that capture my interest or motivate me to put effort into them.\" -- captures the *absence* of promotion focus.\n\nOn the original scale, \"Very often\" = 5. However, because this is a **negatively worded item**, we reverse the scoring:\n\n-   Original 5 â†’ Reversed to 1\n\n-   Original 4 â†’ Reversed to 2\n\n-   Original 3 â†’ Stays 3\n\n-   Original 2 â†’ Reversed to 4\n\n-   Original 1 â†’ Reversed to 5\n\nTherefore, if someone reports \"Very often\" (5) for `FOCUS_6`, after reverse coding it becomes 1, correctly reflecting LOW promotion focus.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Understanding the `-` symbol\n\nThe minus sign (`-`) before an item name tells `scoreItems()` to reverse code that item.\n\nExample: - `\"FOCUS_6\"` = use original scores - `\"-FOCUS_6\"` = reverse the scores (1â†’5, 2â†’4, 3â†’3, 4â†’2, 5â†’1)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reverse coding items based on scoring key from here: https://sjdm.org/dmidi/Regulatory_Focus_Questionnaire.html .
