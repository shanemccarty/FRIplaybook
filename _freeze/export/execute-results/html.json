For example, if the date is 10\\.18\\.2025 then the correct format of the files should be: 10\\.18\\.2025.data.team1.csv and 10\\.18\\.2025.data.team1.xlsx\n\n- [ ] Make a copy of the 10\\.18\\.2025.data.team1.xlsx and rename it to: 10\\.18\\.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx. This will be the dataset you use to IMPORT. \n\n- [ ] In google sheets, open up the file with .clean added to the original file (i.e., 10\\.18\\.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx) and delete the second row. You'll notice that the dataset has two headers for variables and labels. You need to delete Row 2 to eliminate the labels. \n\n- [ ] Go to file > download > Microsoft Excel.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, you can move to the next chapter to import your data (10\\.18\\.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx) to R or NVivo. \n",
