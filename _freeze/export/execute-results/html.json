Researchers learn to prepare their data by naming variables and recoding values directly in Qualtrics before export, ensuring numerical values are properly assigned to response options. The chapter covers three essential exports: the survey instrument as a Word document for documentation, the raw dataset as an Excel file with numerical values, and a cleaned version with duplicate header rows removed. Researchers practice proper file naming conventions using date-stamped formats (MONTH.DAY.YEAR.data.team#.filetype) to track multiple data exports throughout their research project. By the end of this chapter, students will have properly formatted, team-specific datasets ready for import into data analysis software, following reproducible research standards for data management and version control.\ndate: 10.20.2025\ndate-format: \"MM.DD.YYYY\"\nkeywords:\n  - export\n  - qualtrics\n  - label variables\n  - recode values\nformat: html\neditor: visual\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## **updated 10/20/2025 at 10:00pm**\n\nMost of the export and renaming details were updated. Also, team-specific file conventions were included.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Name and Recode Variables in Qualtrics\n\n-   [ ] Log into Qualtrics: <https://binghamton.co1.qualtrics.com>\n\n    -   [ ] Under Active surveys, click on your survey\n\n-   [ ] Recode variables in Qualtrics\n\n-   [ ] Visit \"Recode Values\" section of the [Qualtrics guide](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/)\n\n-   [ ] Follow the instructions on how to [name and recode values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ynxeoIaLhABAAeDLJYV1MwQRwpI8LM24Zd3tOwxcFQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.25d8wyh38wre)\n\n-   [ ] Click \"publish\" in Qualtrics to save your recodes\n\n## Export Survey Questions/Items (`.docx`)\n\n-   [ ] Log into Qualtrics: <https://binghamton.co1.qualtrics.com>\n\n    -   [ ] Under Active surveys, click on your survey\n\n-   [ ] Click on Survey \\> Import/Export \\> \"Export Survey to Word\" to download a copy of the entire survey questions/statements as they would appear in the online Qualtrics survey. As a reminder, you already did this for your IRB submission.\n\n-   [ ] Open the document in Microsoft Word (not google docs) to confirm it works. Then, save it as `10.20.2025.ExportedSurvey.docx`.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## üìÅ For Teams 2 and 5\n\n**Your files should be named:**\n\n*Files for Team 2:*\n\n-   `10.20.2025.ExportedSurvey.Daily.docx`\n\n-   `10.20.2025.ExportedSurvey.Day17.docx`\n\n*Files for Team 5:*\n\n-   `10.20.2025.ExportedSurvey.Veggie.docx`\n\n-   `10.20.2025.ExportedSurvey.Perception.docx`\n:::\n\n-   [ ] Open your \"Team Survey Data\" on google drive and click + New \\> File Upload and select your document.\n\n![*Click on Survey \\> Import/Export \\> Export Survey to Word*](images/export-survey.png)\n\n## Export Survey Data (`.xlsx`)\n\n-   [ ] At the top, go to Data & Analysis tab (top navigation bar) and ensure that \"Data\" is selected (from the second navigation bar)\n\n![*Click on Data & Analysis and ensure Data is underlined in the navigation bars.*](images/export-navbar.png)\n\n-   [ ] On the upper right side, click Export & Import \\^, then select Export Data...\n\n-   [ ] Click the Excel tab, check download all fields, check *export values* (and do NOT select *export labels*), and click the download button.\n\n![*Select the excel option of the multiple file type options (csv, tsv, SPSS) and select key choices before download*](images/export-excel.png)\n\n-   [ ] Open the file in Microsoft Word as `.docx` and check that numerical values are shown in parentheses (e.g., Poor (1) next to the response options\n\n![\\*Confirm your closed-ended questions/items have response options with numerical values for each response option](images/export-survey-recode.png)\n\n-   [ ] Upload both files to \"Team Survey Data\" folder in your Team ELN\n\n## Rename Files and Download\n\n-   [ ] **Rename `.xlsx` file** using the date of the export in this format: MONTH.DAY.YEAR.data.team#.filetype. For example, if the date is 10.20.2025 then the correct format of the files should be: 10.20.2025.data.team1.xlsx\n\n-   [ ] **Make a copy** of the `10.20.2025.data.team1.xlsx` and rename it to: `10.20.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx.`\n\n-   [ ] In google sheets, **open up the file with .clean** added to the original file (i.e., `10.20.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx`) and **delete the second row (with labels and questions/items)**. You'll notice that the dataset has two headers for variables and labels. You need to delete Row 2 to eliminate those labels.\n\n-   [ ] Go to File \\> **Download** \\> Microsoft Excel.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, you can move to the next chapter to import your data (`10.20.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx`) to R or NVivo.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tips for Data Files\n\n**Rename files** using the date of the export, following MONTH.DAY.YEAR.data.team#.filetype. For example, if you export on 10.20.2025 then the correct format of the files should be: 10.20.2025.data.team1.xlsx. Then, 10.20.2025.data.team1.xlsx should be changed to 10.20.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx after removing the second row.\n\nIt is important to include the date in your file names because you may download data at different stages of the recruitment process (e.g., after a brief pilot phase, halfway, and at the end). For example, Team 2 will continue collecting data until mid November. The final export for Team 2 will be on Monday, November 10th, resulting in a final dataset (i.e., `11.10.2025.data.team2.xlsx`).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## üìÅ Team 1 File Names\n\n**Your files should be named:**\n\n-   10.20.2025.data.team1.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## üìÅ Team 2 File Names\n\n**Your files should be named:**\n\n-   10.20.2025.dailydata.team2.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.day17data.team2.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.dailydata.team2.clean.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.day17data.team2.clean.xlsx\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## üìÅ Team 3 File Names\n\n**Your files should be named:**\n\n-   10.20.2025.data.team3.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.data.team3.clean.xlsx\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## üìÅ Team 4 File Names\n\n**Your files should be named:**\n\n-   10.20.2025.data.team4.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.data.team4.clean.xlsx\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## üìÅ Team 5 File Names\n\n**Your files should be named:**\n\n-   10.20.2025.veggiedata.team5.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.perceptiondata.team5.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.veggiedata.team5.clean.xlsx\n-   10.20.2025.perceptiondata.team5.clean.xlsx\n:::\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger: Common Mistakes\n\n-   **Naming Files ‚Äì** Make sure there are NO spaces anywhere in your file.
