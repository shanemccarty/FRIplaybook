  This short guide explains how to set up and manage APA-style citations and references in Quarto markdown documents. Specifically, students learn how to add a bibliography file, insert in-text citations using Visual mode, include uncited references with the `nocite` field, and automatically generate a bibliography at the end of the report. By following these steps, students will be able to properly cite articles, web pages, and other sources within a Quarto report.

# **1. Add "bibliography: references.bib" to the YAML**

This line tells Quarto to create and use a file called `references.bib`, which you can find in the **Files** section.

To format your references in APA style, also include the line `csl: apa.csl` in the YAML header.

```{markdown}
---
title: "APA citations"
author: "Zihan Hei"
format: html
editor: visual

bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl
---
```

# **2. Download the `apa.csl` file from Zotero**

## Find APA Style in Zotero

1.  **Open Zotero.**

2.  Go to the **menu bar** (top left).

    -   On **Windows**: click **Edit ‚Äì\> Settings**

    -   On **Mac**: click **Zotero ‚Äì\> Settings**

3.  In the left sidebar, select **Cite** ‚Äì\> then click the **Styles** tab.

4.  At the bottom of the style list, click **‚ÄúGet additional styles‚Ä¶‚Äù**

    -   This opens the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=apa&utm_source=chatgpt.com) inside your browser.

5.  Search for **APA** ‚Äî you‚Äôll see this:

    -   *American Psychological Association 7th edition*

6.  Click the name of the style and Zotero will **automatically install** it into your local Zotero library.

## Finding the CSL File

We need the actual `.csl` file for Quarto:

1.  After installing it, go to Zotero‚Äôs data directory:

-   On Windows: `C:\Users\<YourName>\Zotero\styles`

    -   C: drives ‚Äì\> folder with your name ‚Äì\> Zotero folder ‚Äì\> styles folder

-   On macOS: `Home/Zotero/styles`

    -   Home folder ‚Äì\> Zotero folder ‚Äì\> styles folder

2.  Find the file named something like `apa.csl` or `apa-7th-edition.csl`.

3.  Upload it into your Quarto project folder, and in your YAML, include:

```{markdown}
---
csl: apa.csl     

or 

csl: apa-7th-edition.csl    
---
```

# **3. Insert Citations in Visual Mode**

1.  Find your article‚Äôs **DOI** and copy it.

2.  In the **Visual** editor, click **Insert** ‚Äî\> **Citation**.

3.  Paste your DOI then search your article under "From DOI", "Crossref", "DataCite" or "PubMed".

4.  Before you click insert, make sure the **Add to bibliography file** option points to `references.bib`.

5.  Choose **In-text** and click **Insert**.

    ![](playbook/insert-citation.png)

-   The correct citation should look like this: (@offer2025)

-   If you want to cite multiple sources in one set of parentheses, separate them with semicolons: (@offer2025; @johnson2018; @obrien2024)

# **4. Including Uncited Items**

If you want certain references to appear in your bibliography without citing them in the text, you can define a `nocite` field in your YAML like this:

```{markdown}
---
nocite: |
  @kannan2014
---
```

This means "\@kannan2014" will not appear in the body text, but it will still be listed in your final **bibliography.**

For example, if you want to include Dr.Shane's *Quantitative Playbook* (which doesn't have a DOI but has a web link), you can manually add it to your `references.bib` file:

```{markdown}
@article{McCarty2025, 
  title = {The Quantitative Playbook for Public Health Research in R},
  year = {2025},
  author = {McCarty, S.},
  url = {https://shanemccarty.github.io/FRIplaybook/},
  langid = {en}
}
```

After this, make sure you put it in the YAML using `nocite`:

```{markdown}
---
nocite: |
  @McCarty2025
---
```

# **5. Bibliography Generation**

By default, Quarto will automatically generate a list of cited works and will be placed at the end of the document.

## Tip with Title

Citations and references are not required for the Results & Discussion Report ( `RDreport.qmd` ), but they are required for the final report.
