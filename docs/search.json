    "text": "Preface\nIn the FRI Public Health research stream at Binghamton University, student research teams explore a variety of biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health. Some teams collect biological measures using the MUSE S headband and fitbit charge 6. Most teams collect self-report survey data on psychological and sociodemographics via Qualtrics. Some teams design online behavioral experiments to examine cause-and-effect relationships. To analyze quantitative data in R, the FRI Public Health Lab has created this playbook with a variety of “plays” (R code) for students in the quantitative data analysis track to use for their team-based research projects.\nThe most successful sports teams rely on well-designed plays to navigate complex game situations. The FRI Public Health research stream uses strategic data analysis “plays” to tackle the multifaceted challenges of health promotion and disease prevention. Our research stream explores the intricate biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health by collecting physiological data through wearables like MUSE S and Fitbits, psychological insights via survey questionnaires and interviews, and behavioral patterns through online experiments. Ultimately, our research aims to connect the dots between biological, social, political, commercial, and economic determinants of health behavior, outcomes, and inequities.\nLike a coach calling the right play at the crucial moment, this playbook equips you and your research teams with proven strategies from the tidyverse for importing data, tidying data in tidyr, transforming data in dplyr, visualizing data in ggplot2, modeling with stats, and communicating science reproducibly in quarto. Each “play” in this guide has been field-tested by research teams who have successfully used quantitative techniques to answer pressing questions about physical and mental health. Whether you’re facing a complex dataset for the first time or looking to refine your analytical strategy, this playbook offers guidance for you to turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom in order to improve public health outcomes.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 Reproducible Reports\nThe growing concern about the inability to reproduce published scientific research findings is known as the replication or reproducibility crisis.\nA Nature paper by Baker (2016) states: “More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.”\nThe failure to reproduce research is a function of systems pressure (defunding of public higher education), intentional actions (fraudulent scientific practices), unintentional decision-making (e.g., human error when clicking software, poor note-taking), and scientific training (e.g., methodology sections without clear protocols and details). Reproducible research is both an intentional practice and the outcome of scientific training emphasizing a specific workflow.\nA primary objective of this playbook is to increase the reproducibility of public health research using line-by-line coding in R with Quarto for publishing the research with code chunks to confirm accuracy.\nYou and your team will produce a reproducible Quarto Markdown report (.qmd) for your individual report and team manuscript. Specific instructions are provided in the next chapter.\nQuarto provided two examples of a reproducible report and manuscript:\nThe FRI Public Health Lab has produced Quarto manuscripts from active research projects:",

    "section": "3.3 Code Chunks",
    "text": "3.3 Code Chunks\nA traditional R script (.R) involves code throughout the entire script. A Quarto Markdown Document (.qmd) integrates the R programming language with markdown language into a single document that can include a mix of code and written content. We use report.qmd and other .qmd files to write a reproducible manuscript using written text within embedded code chunks.\n\n3.3.1 Example Code Chunk\nBelow is an example from the @ggplot2.qmd chapter of an informative label for your code chunk and a very detailed figure caption ( fig-cap). Also, notice that all code chunk options start with #| and use a :.\nFor more examples, see @ggplot2.qmd.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| eval: false\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n```\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Template Code Chunk\n\nLabel for All Code Chunks\nYour #| label: should be lowercase with dashs between words to create a complete object with no spaces, such as import-data-csv or import-data-xlsx.\n```{r}\n#| label: import-data-xlsx\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery code chunk must have a #| label: at the start of the chunk.\n\n\n\n\nFigure Caption (Fig-Cap) for Plot Code Chunks\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: provide a detailed figure caption\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery plot should include a detailed figure caption using #| fig-cap:\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Text for Figures and Images (Fig-Alt)\nEvery image and figure/plot/graph/table should be accessible to people with blindness or low vision. By providing alt text, you are explaining the figure and image with enough detail for a screen reader. This is a requirement of Binghamton University based on federal law.\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: provide a detailed figure caption\n#| fig-alt: provide info for accessiblity\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery figure and image should include alternative text using #| fig-alt:\n\n\nFor more information on how improve the accessiblity of an image, see figures-alt-text on Quarto to use alt text to increase accessiblity.\n\n\nProvide Sources for ALL Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nAt the end of every code chunk, include the source of the code chunk so that others can replicate your work. You should use a pseudo APA citation format with (author, year) and website link (if possible).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: you need to revise this with detailed figure caption\n\n#source example 1: The FRI Playbook (McCarty, 2025)   \n#source example 2: Writing Reproducible Results (Hei, 2025)   \n#source example 3: Quarto guide markdown basics: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip“#|” vs. “#”\n\n\n\nThe format is different for the code chunk options that use #| (e.g., #| label:) vs. sourcing using # to comment (e.g., #source:). The #source will be at the bottom of your code chunk.\n\n\n\n\nProvide Explanation for ALL Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nYou will explain the code chunk in your own words using #explanation: at the bottom of your code chunk.\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| eval: false\n\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n```\n\n\n\nSetting library code chunk\nBy setting the #| output: to false, none of the output from running the code will show up. Only the code chunk for loading the library has #| output: false. The output is “attaching package (readxl), which is not necessary for our report. In almost all cases, your code chunk will NOT include the output option. If you do include it, it will mostly be set to true in order for you to output results, a plot, etc.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-library-readxl\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n\n\n\nCode Chunk Options\nFor more information on code chunks, see code chunk options.\n```{r}\n#| label: example-with-options\n#| eval: true          # Whether to execute the code\n#| output: true        # Whether to display output\n#| warning: false      # Hide warnings\n#| message: false      # Hide messages\n#| error: false        # Hide errors\n#| fig-cap: \"Caption\"  # Figure caption\n#| fig-width: 8        # Figure width in inches\n#| fig-height: 6       # Figure height in inches\n\n# Your code here below these code chunk options\n\n```",

Public health researchers work with data from many sources and in many formats. In FRI-PH, we will import data from a survey collected in the software Qualtrics.\nCommon data sources:\n# Load packages (do this each session)\nlibrary(NHANES)    # CDC health data\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data wrangling (includes readr)\nlibrary(readxl)    # Read Excel files\nlibrary(haven)     # Read SPSS/SAS/Stata files",

The primary advantage of using Excel files is the ability to manually inspect your data using Excel or Google sheets before you import into R. Below are code chunks that can be copied into your report if you are using an excel file with the header in row 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUse the .clean data file: 10.20.2025.data.team1.clean.xlsx with a header in row 1 only. If you manually inspect your data and you see labels in row 2, you need to clean the dataset.\n\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n# Import Excel file\nsafetydata &lt;- read_excel(\n

Here, we’ve clicked our user icon in the top right and gone to “Account Settings.” You’re going to need these strings later.\nNext, you’re going to need your survey ID. When you click on the survey that contains the live data, the URL will look something like this: https://binghamton.yul1.qualtrics.com/survey-builder/SV_6mOC1SaJbecAuP0/edit The survey ID is the string between survey-builder/ and /edit, in this case, being “SV_6mOC1SaJbecAuP0”\nGetting into the actual code, we have the following steps: ## Import necessary packages:\n\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(readr)",

    "text": "7.1.1 Long Form\nImagine you collected data on WELLBEING and SLEEP at Day 1 and Day 7 of a 7-day study for a participant whose participant ID is PASSWORD. This data is correct, but problematic for analyzing within-person change because abc123 appears on its own row twice. Our preference is one row per participant.\n\nExample of long form data format where each case/row refers to a SURVEY RESPONSE submitted on Day 1 or 7.\n\n\nPASSWORD\nDAY\nWELLBEING\nSLEEP\n\n\n\n\nabc123\n1\n3.2\n42\n\n\ngobills7\n1\n7.8\n83\n\n\nabc123\n7\n1.2\n17\n\n\ngobills7\n7\n5.8\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Wide Form\nUsing the tidyr package, long form data can be converted to wide form using the DAY variable. In this case, survey responses are removed from a row and moved to new columns that capture Day 7 responses at Time 2 (T2) using the PASSWORD.\n\nExample of wide form data format where each case/row refers to a specific PARTICIPANT. Now, there are only 2 rows x 4 columns with DAY dropped from the columns because there is no longer a DAY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPASSWORD\nWELLBEING_T1\nWELLBEING_T2\nSLEEP_T1\nSLEEP_T2\n\n\n\n\nabc123\n3.2\n1.2\n42\n17\n\n\ngobills7\n7.8\n5.8\n83\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 R Code\n\nExample 1\nThe code used to transition from long to wide data format here is as follows:\n```{r}\n#| label: long-to-wide\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n## Convert to wide format\nwide_data &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = DAY,\n    values_from = c(WELLBEING, SLEEP), \n    names_glue = \"{.value}_T{DAY}\" \n  )\n```\nHere, we reference the “DAY” column in the long dataset as the column we are trying to eliminate as we transition to wide format. As seen in the wide format, we now have two separate columns for wellbeing and sleep: one at day 1 and another at day 7.\n\n\nExample 2\nAnother example can be found in the next chapter on visualizing pre and posttest scores.\nBelow is the example code:\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Create long format with separate columns for each SE type\nlongdata &lt;- pivot_longer(oralhealthdata_prepost,\n                        cols = c(\"BSE_T1\", \"BSE_T2\", \"CSE_T1\", \"CSE_T2\", \"ISE_T1\", \"ISE_T2\"),\n                        names_to = c(\"SE_type\", \"Time\"),\n                        names_pattern = \"(.+)_(.+)\",\n                        values_to = \"SE\",\n                        values_drop_na = TRUE)\n\n# Convert T1/T2 to before/after\nlongdata$Time &lt;- ifelse(longdata$Time == \"T1\", \"before\", \"after\")\n\n# Pivot wider to get separate columns for each SE type\nlongdata &lt;- pivot_wider(longdata,\n                       names_from = SE_type,\n                       values_from = SE)\n\n# Keep only the desired columns\nlongdata &lt;- longdata[, c(\"Time\", \"BSE\", \"CSE\", \"ISE\")]\n\nlongdata$Time &lt;- factor(longdata$Time, levels = c('before','after'))\n\nlongdata_long &lt;- pivot_longer(longdata, cols = c(BSE, CSE, ISE), \n               names_to = \"SelfEfficacy\", \n               values_to = \"Score\")\n\nlongdata_long$SelfEfficacy &lt;- factor(longdata_long$SelfEfficacy, levels = c(\"BSE\", \"CSE\", \"ISE\"))\nlongdata_long$Time &lt;- factor(longdata_long$Time, levels = c(\"before\", \"after\"))\n\nlongdata_long &lt;- longdata %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(BSE, CSE, ISE), \n               names_to = \"SelfEfficacy\", \n               values_to = \"Score\")\n\n# Create a new variable combining 'SelfEfficacy' and 'Time'\nlongdata_long$SelfEfficacyTime &lt;- factor(\n  paste(longdata_long$SelfEfficacy, longdata_long$Time),\n  levels = c(\"BSE before\", \"BSE after\", \"CSE before\", \"CSE after\", \"ISE before\", \"ISE after\")\n)\n\n```\nIn this example, Erica converts from wide to long data in order to more easily compare time 1 vs time 2 data. This data format is not only for binary time categories either, it can be applicable to projects with data across multiple days.",

    "text": "8.3 Decision Tree\nYour research question can be classified as comparative research or relationship research (Barroga & Matanguihan, 2022).\n\n\n\nThe decision tree helps researchers to identify the specific statistical technique based on their comparative or relationship research question\n\n\n\n8.3.1 Relationship Research\nFor relationship research, the variables are 📏 Continuous because they range along a continuum, such as a scale for beliefs from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). To examine the relationship between two continous variables, use the steps below to build a custom scatterplot.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP TO BUILD A SCATTERPLOT\n\n\nStep 1: Set up data and mapping\nWhat is the relationship between BMI and insurance charges?\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a blank canvas with our axes defined, but no data displayed yet!\n\n\nStep 2: Add geometry (points)\nAdd points to create a scatterplot using geom_point():\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Add a statistical layer (trend line)\nAdd a linear model line with geom_smooth():\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges)) + geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how it looks like we have two different populations? Let’s explore this further.\n\n\nOptional – Step 4. Incorporate grouping (color)\nThere are two main approaches to visualizing grouping variables:\n\nMethod 1: Using Color\nMap the smoker variable to color:\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges)) + geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Using Facets\nCreate separate panels for each group with facet_wrap():\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  facet_wrap(~smoker)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth methods reveal that smoking status significantly affects the relationship between BMI and insurance charges!\n\n\n\nStep 5. Customize Appearance\n\nAdding Titles and Labels\nMake your plot more informative with descriptive titles:\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Insurance charges vs \n          BMI for smokers and non-smokers\") +\n  xlab(\"Body Mass Index (BMI)\") +\n  ylab(\"Insurance Charges\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the Theme\nApply a professional theme with theme_bw():\n\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Insurance charges vs \n          BMI for smokers and non-smokers\") +\n  xlab(\"Body Mass Index (BMI)\") +\n  ylab(\"Insurance Charges\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\na scatterplot depicting a linear relationship between BMI and insurance charges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantSelect a theme\n\n\n\nTeam members should pick one theme (from the complete themes) to use with all plots in the individual reports and the team manuscript!\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting Axis Scales\nSometimes, you need to manually control the range of your axes for better visualization or to match other plots or to capture the entire range of the possible response options (e.g., 1-6, 1-10, 1 - 100).\nSet specific limits with xlim() and ylim().\n\nggplot(data = insurance, \n       mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  xlim(15, 55) +  # Set x-axis from 15 to 55\n  ylim(0, 65000) +  # Set y-axis from 0 to 65000\n  ggtitle(\"Insurance charges vs BMI for smokers and non-smokers\") +\n  xlab(\"Body Mass Index (BMI)\") +\n  ylab(\"Insurance Charges\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWarning: Data outside limits will be removed\n\n\n\nUsing xlim() and ylim() removes any data points outside the specified range. This can affect trend lines!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement: X and Y Axes\n\n\n\nIf your response options range from 1 to 6. Use ylim( ) to adjust the y-axis to range from 1 to 6 too.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Colors\nWant to improve your plots with colors?\n\n4 ways to use colors in ggplot2 more efficiently\nDealing with colors in ggplot2\nCustomizing ggplot2 color and fill scales\nHow to use better colors in ggplot (youtube)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Comparative Research\nComparative research questions examine mean score differences on a continuous (quantitative) variable based on real or artificial (researcher-decided) group membership. Simply put, comparative research offers a way of comparing different categories to one another. These categories can be:\n\n🏷️ Nominal Data (Gender Identity)\n\n-   Man\n-   Woman\n-   Non-Binary\n\n📶 Ordinal Data (Age Group)\n\n18 - 35\n36 - 54\n55 - 75\n76+\n\n\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP TO BUILD A BARPLOT WITH geom_bar()\nBar plots are useful for comparing mean scores across groups.\n\n\nStep 1: Set up data and mapping\n\nplot_region_charges &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = insurance,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = region,\n    y = charges)\n  )\n\n## there is nothing to see yet! \n\n\n\nStep 2: Add geometry (bars)\n\nplot_region_charges &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = insurance,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = region,\n    y = charges)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'summary', fun = 'mean')\n\n\n\nStep 3: Customize bars\n\nplot_region_charges &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = insurance,\n  mapping = aes(\n    x = region,\n    y = charges)) +\n  geom_bar(\n    stat = 'summary',\n    fun = 'mean',\n    fill = \"#005a43\")\n\n\n\nStep 4: Add labels and themes\n\nplot_region_charges &lt;- ggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = region, y = charges)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = 'summary', fun = 'mean', fill = \"#005a43\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Mean Insurance Charges Based on Region\") + \n  xlab(\"Region\") +\n  ylab(\"Insurance Charges\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\nStep 5: save plot as image using ggsave()\nggsave( ) is a specific function to save a plot as an image in .jpg or .png image.

    "text": "12.3 Inline R Code\nThe traditional process of writing a results section of a research paper usually involves three steps: 1) running the analyses, 2) copying statistics and p-values from the data analysis software into a word document, and 3) writing text to interpret the results. In each of these steps, researchers can make an error. Using inline R code eliminates step2 of copying-and-pasting of numbers into a report or manuscript and reduces parts of step 3. Below are a few examples of how to use inline R code to generate numbers or text using functions:\n\nReport Sample Size\nReport Numbers and Percentages\nWrite Numbers as Words\nReport Descriptive Stats in a Table\nReport a Parameter and p-value",
