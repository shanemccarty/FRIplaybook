    "text": "Preface\nStudents in the FRI Public Health research stream at Binghamton University explore a variety of biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health. This playbook includes a variety of “plays” (R code) that students in the quantitative data analysis track can use for their team-based research projects.\nThe most successful sports teams rely on well-designed plays to navigate complex game situations. The FRI Public Health research stream uses strategic data analysis “plays” to tackle the multifaceted challenges of promoting wellbeing, preventing disease, and protecting health. Our research stream explores the intricate biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health by collecting physiological data through wearables like MUSE S and Fitbits, psychological insights via survey questionnaires and interviews, and behavioral patterns through online experiments. Like a coach calling the right play at the crucial moment, this playbook equips you and your research teams with proven strategies for importing, tidying, transforming, visualizing, modeling, and communicating the mixed-methods data that helps us connect the dots between social, political, commercial, and economic determinants of health behavior, outcomes, and inequities. Each “play” in this guide has been field-tested by research teams who have successfully used quantitative and qualitative approaches to answer pressing questions about physical and mental health. Whether you’re facing a complex dataset for the first time or looking to refine your analytical strategy, this playbook offers guidance for you to turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom in order to improve public health outcomes.\nTo learn more about the FRI Public Health stream, visit us at: https://fripublichealth.quarto.pub.",

    "text": "2.1 Reproducible Reports\nA Nature paper by Baker (2016) states: “More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.”\nThe failure to reproduce research is a function of systems pressure (defunding of public higher education), intentional actions (fraudulent scientific practices), unintentional decision-making (e.g., human error when clicking software, poor note-taking), and scientific training (e.g., methodology sections without clear protocols and details). Reproducible research is both an intentional practice and the outcome of scientific training emphasizing a specific workflow.\nA primary objective of this playbook is to increase the reproducibility of public health research using line-by-line coding in R with Quarto for publishing the research with code chunks to confirm accuracy.\nYou and your team will produce a reproducible Quarto Markdown report (.qmd) for your individual report and team manuscript. Specific instructions are provided in the next chapter.\nQuarto provided two examples of a reproducible report and manuscript:\nThe FRI Public Health Lab has produced Quarto manuscripts from active research projects:",

A Quarto Markdown Document (.qmd) integrates the R programming language with markdown language into a single document that can include a mix of code and written content. We use report.qmd and other .qmd files to write a reproducible manuscript using written text within embedded code chunks.\n\n3.4.1 Example Code Chunk\nBelow is an example from the @ggplot2.qmd chapter of an informative label for your code chunk and a very detailed figure caption ( fig-cap). Also, notice that all code chunk options start with #| and use a :.\nFor more examples, see @ggplot2.qmd.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| eval: false\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n```\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Template Code Chunk\n\nLabel for All Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery code chunk must have a #| label: at the start of the chunk.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: this is a label that you will revise\n\n```\nYour #| label: should be lowercase with dashs between words to create a complete object with no spaces, such as import-data-csv or import-data-xlsx.\n```{r}\n#| label: import-data-xlsx\n\n```\n\n\nFigure Caption (Fig-Cap) for Plot Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery plot should include a detailed figure caption using #| fig-cap:\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: you need to revise this with detailed figure caption\n\n```\n\n\nProvide Sources for ALL Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nAt the end of every code chunk, include the source of the code chunk so that others can replicate your work.
