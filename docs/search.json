    "text": "Preface\nIn the FRI Public Health research stream at Binghamton University, student research teams explore a variety of biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health. Some teams collect biological measures using the MUSE S headband and fitbit charge 6. Most teams collect self-report survey data on psychological and sociodemographics via Qualtrics. Some teams design online behavioral experiments to examine cause-and-effect relationships. To analyze quantitative data in R, the FRI Public Health Lab has created this playbook with a variety of “plays” (R code) for students in the quantitative data analysis track to use for their team-based research projects.\nThe most successful sports teams rely on well-designed plays to navigate complex game situations. The FRI Public Health research stream uses strategic data analysis “plays” to tackle the multifaceted challenges of health promotion and disease prevention. Our research stream explores the intricate biopsychosocial factors affecting human physical and mental health by collecting physiological data through wearables like MUSE S and Fitbits, psychological insights via survey questionnaires and interviews, and behavioral patterns through online experiments. Ultimately, our research aims to connect the dots between biological, social, political, commercial, and economic determinants of health behavior, outcomes, and inequities.\nLike a coach calling the right play at the crucial moment, this playbook equips you and your research teams with proven strategies from the tidyverse for importing data, tidying data in tidyr, transforming data in dplyr, visualizing data in ggplot2, modeling with stats, and communicating science reproducibly in quarto. Each “play” in this guide has been field-tested by research teams who have successfully used quantitative techniques to answer pressing questions about physical and mental health. Whether you’re facing a complex dataset for the first time or looking to refine your analytical strategy, this playbook offers guidance for you to turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom in order to improve public health outcomes.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 Reproducible Reports\nThe growing concern about the inability to reproduce published scientific research findings is known as the replication or reproducibility crisis.\nA Nature paper by Baker (2016) states: “More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.”\nThe failure to reproduce research is a function of systems pressure (defunding of public higher education), intentional actions (fraudulent scientific practices), unintentional decision-making (e.g., human error when clicking software, poor note-taking), and scientific training (e.g., methodology sections without clear protocols and details). Reproducible research is both an intentional practice and the outcome of scientific training emphasizing a specific workflow.\nA primary objective of this playbook is to increase the reproducibility of public health research using line-by-line coding in R with Quarto for publishing the research with code chunks to confirm accuracy.\nYou and your team will produce a reproducible Quarto Markdown report (.qmd) for your individual report and team manuscript. Specific instructions are provided in the next chapter.\nQuarto provided two examples of a reproducible report and manuscript:\nThe FRI Public Health Lab has produced Quarto manuscripts from active research projects:",

    "text": "3.4 Code Chunks\nA traditional R script (.R) involves code throughout the entire script. A Quarto Markdown Document (.qmd) integrates the R programming language with markdown language into a single document that can include a mix of code and written content. We use report.qmd and other .qmd files to write a reproducible manuscript using written text within embedded code chunks.\n\n3.4.1 Example Code Chunk\nBelow is an example from the @ggplot2.qmd chapter of an informative label for your code chunk and a very detailed figure caption ( fig-cap). Also, notice that all code chunk options start with #| and use a :.\nFor more examples, see @ggplot2.qmd.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| eval: false\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n```\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Template Code Chunk\n\nLabel for All Code Chunks\nYour #| label: should be lowercase with dashs between words to create a complete object with no spaces, such as import-data-csv or import-data-xlsx.\n```{r}\n#| label: import-data-xlsx\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery code chunk must have a #| label: at the start of the chunk.\n\n\n\n\nFigure Caption (Fig-Cap) for Plot Code Chunks\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: provide a detailed figure caption\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery plot should include a detailed figure caption using #| fig-cap:\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Text for Figures and Images (Fig-Alt)\nEvery image and figure/plot/graph/table should be accessible to people with blindness or low vision. By providing alt text, you are explaining the figure and image with enough detail for a screen reader. This is a requirement of Binghamton University based on federal law.\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: provide a detailed figure caption\n#| fig-alt: provide info for accessiblity\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nEvery figure and image should include alternative text using #| fig-alt:\n\n\nFor more information on how improve the accessiblity of an image, see figures-alt-text on Quarto to use alt text to increase accessiblity.\n\n\nProvide Sources for ALL Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nAt the end of every code chunk, include the source of the code chunk so that others can replicate your work. You should use a pseudo APA citation format with (author, year) and website link (if possible).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: you need to revise this with detailed figure caption\n\n#source example 1: The FRI Playbook (McCarty, 2025)   \n#source example 2: Writing Reproducible Results (Hei, 2025)   \n#source example 3: Quarto guide markdown basics: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip“#|” vs. “#”\n\n\n\nThe format is different for the code chunk options that use #| (e.g., #| label:) vs. sourcing using # to comment (e.g., #source:). The #source will be at the bottom of your code chunk.\n\n\n\n\nProvide Explanation for ALL Code Chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRequirement\n\n\n\nYou will explain the code chunk in your own words using #explanation: at the bottom of your code chunk.\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| eval: false\n\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n```\n\n\n\nSetting library code chunk\nBy setting the #| output: to false, none of the output from running the code will show up. Only the code chunk for loading the library has #| output: false. The output is “attaching package (readxl), which is not necessary for our report. In almost all cases, your code chunk will NOT include the output option. If you do include it, it will mostly be set to true in order for you to output results, a plot, etc.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-library-readxl\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n\n\n\nCode Chunk Options\nFor more information on code chunks, see code chunk options.\n```{r}\n#| label: example-with-options\n#| eval: true          # Whether to execute the code\n#| output: true        # Whether to display output\n#| warning: false      # Hide warnings\n#| message: false      # Hide messages\n#| error: false        # Hide errors\n#| fig-cap: \"Caption\"  # Figure caption\n#| fig-width: 8        # Figure width in inches\n#| fig-height: 6       # Figure height in inches\n\n# Your code here below these code chunk options\n\n```",

Public health researchers work with data from many sources and in many formats. In FRI-PH, we will import data from a survey collected in the software Qualtrics.\nCommon data sources:\n# Load packages (do this each session)\nlibrary(NHANES)    # CDC health data\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data wrangling (includes readr)\nlibrary(readxl)    # Read Excel files\nlibrary(haven)     # Read SPSS/SAS/Stata files",

    "text": "10.3 Inline R Code\nThe traditional process of writing a results section of a research paper usually involves three steps: 1) running the analyses, 2) copying statistics and p-values from the data analysis software into a word document, and 3) writing text to interpret the results. In each of these steps, researchers can make an error. Using inline R code eliminates step2 of copying-and-pasting of numbers into a report or manuscript and reduces parts of step 3. Below are a few examples of how to use inline R code to generate numbers or text using functions:\n\nReport Sample Size\nReport Numbers and Percentages\nWrite Numbers as Words\nReport Descriptive Stats in a Table\nReport a Parameter and p-value",
