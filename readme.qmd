## Read Me

A `readme.qmd` file instructs someone else to *read me*. It provides basic information and contextual information to a colleague who wants to replicate or check your work.

To see an example of an excellent read me file, see [zero sum report read me](https://fripublichealth.quarto.pub/zerosum/readme-preview.html)
