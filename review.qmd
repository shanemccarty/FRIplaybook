  This chapter introduces the use of Hypothes.is to comment on Quarto reports. These can be used to give and receive feedback on your/other teams' papers, and there are certain functions of Hypothes.is that allow certain comments to only be seen by certain people. Therefore, you know where your critiques are coming from. This chapter walks you through the process of leaving these comments on a report.

To follow along with this chapter, see the [Zero Sum Paper](https://fripublichealth.quarto.pub/zerosum/) which we will add comments to.

Upon opening the paper, you should see the following: ![First Page](review_files/review_login.png)

Clicking the arrow in the top right corner will produce this menu: ![menu](review_files/menu.png)

If you have not created an account yet, you can sign up using your Bmail. The menu more or less provides the instructions, but here is an example annotation: ![First annotation](review_files/annotation1.png)

You can annotate text by selecting anything in the report and choosing "Annotate". Note that this annotation can be made public or private. Similarly, to private annotations, you might want to highlight a specific portion in the text just for yourself. Upon selecting the text, you would instead click "Highlight".

## Groups

Another important function of Hypothes.is is the creation of groups. When you select which group you are annotating under, you can view annotations just made by that group. Similarly, you can post annotations that are only visible to people in that group, such as your own team. To select which group you are currently posting to, go to the top right dropdown as shown here: ![Group dropdown](review_files/group.png)

After creating a group or being invited to one, you can now select to post only to that group when creating an annotation. Additionally, when you have this group selected, you can choose to only read annotations made by members of this group.

Overall, the functioning of commenting should be quite similar by now after working in FRI for the past few semesters. This framework just makes it easier to comment on currently published reports. Good luck!
