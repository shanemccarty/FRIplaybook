## For Teams 2 and 4

This is a required module for Teams 2 and 4 given their long data format.

## Data Formats

### Long Form

Imagine you collected data on `WELLBEING` and `SLEEP` at Day 1 and Day 7 of a 7-day study for a participant whose participant ID is `PASSWORD`. This data is correct, but problematic for analyzing within-person change because abc123 appears on its own row twice. Our preference is one row per participant.

| `PASSWORD` | `DAY` | `WELLBEING` | `SLEEP` |
|------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| abc123     | 1     | 3.2         | 42      |
| gobills7   | 1     | 7.8         | 83      |
| abc123     | 7     | 1.2         | 17      |
| gobills7   | 7     | 5.8         | 68      |

: *Example of long form data format where each case/row refers to a SURVEY RESPONSE submitted on Day 1 or 7.*

### Wide Form

Using the `tidyr` package, long form data can be converted to wide form using the `DAY` variable. In this case, survey responses are removed from a row and moved to new columns that capture Day 7 responses at Time 2 (T2) using the `PASSWORD`.

| `PASSWORD` | `WELLBEING_T1` | `WELLBEING_T2` | `SLEEP_T1` | `SLEEP_T2` |
|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| abc123     | 3.2            | 1.2            | 42         | 17         |
| gobills7   | 7.8            | 5.8            | 83         | 18         |

: *Example of wide form data format where each case/row refers to a specific PARTICIPANT. Now, there are only 2 rows x 4 columns with `DAY`* dropped from the columns because there is no longer a `DAY`.

### R Code

The code used to transition from long to wide data format here is as follows:

```{{r}}
#| label: long-to-wide
library(tidyr)

## Convert to wide format
wide_data <- long_data %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = DAY,
    values_from = c(WELLBEING, SLEEP), 
    names_glue = "{.value}_T{DAY}" 
  )
```

Here, we reference the "DAY" column in the long dataset as the column we are trying to eliminate as we transition to wide format. As seen in the wide format, we now have two separate columns for wellbeing and sleep: one at day 1 and another at day 7.

## Teams

Team 1, 3, and 5 will export data in wide format and will not use `tidyr`. Teams 2 and 4 will need to use `tidyr` to convert their data from long form into wide form.

## Team 2

The Day 1/7 Survey is in long format because a person takes the same survey at Day 1 and 7, resulting in two entries per person. The Daily Survey is in long format because a person takes the same survey 6-7 days, resulting in multiple entries per person.

## Team 4

Survey is in long format due to participants completing the survey twice at the start of the intervention (pretest) and at the end (posttest).
