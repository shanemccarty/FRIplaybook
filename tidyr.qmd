## Data Formats

### Long Form

Imagine you collected data on `WELLBEING` and `SLEEP` at Day 1 and Day 7 of a 7-day study for a participant whose participant ID is `PASSWORD`. This data is correct, but problematic for analyzing within-person change because abc123 appears on its own row twice. Our preference is one row per participant.

| `PASSWORD` | `DAY` | `WELLBEING` | `SLEEP` |
|------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| abc123     | 1     | 3.2         | 42      |
| gobills7   | 1     | 7.8         | 83      |
| abc123     | 7     | 1.2         | 17      |
| gobills7   | 7     | 5.8         | 68      |

: *Example of long form data format where each case/row refers to a SURVEY RESPONSE submitted on Day 1 or 7.*

### Wide Form

Using the `tidyr` package, long form data can be converted to wide form using the `DAY` variable. In this case, survey responses are removed from a row and moved to new columns that capture Day 7 responses at Time 2 (T2) using the `PASSWORD`.

| `PASSWORD` | `WELLBEING_T1` | `WELLBEING_T2` | `SLEEP_T1` | `SLEEP_T2` |
|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| abc123     | 3.2            | 1.2            | 42         | 17         |
| gobills7   | 7.8            | 5.8            | 83         | 18         |

: *Example of wide form data format where each case/row refers to a specific PARTICIPANT. Now, there are only 2 rows x 4 columns with `DAY`* dropped from the columns because there is no longer a `DAY`.

## Teams

Some teams will need to use `tidyr` to convert their data from long form into wide form.

-   Team 2

    -   Day 1/7 Survey is long form where a person takes the same survey at Day 1 and 7, resulting in two entries per person.

    -   Daily Survey is long form where a person takes the same survey 6-7 days, resulting in multiple entries per person.

-   Team 4

    -   Survey is long form due to participants completing the survey twice at the start of the intervention (pretest) and at the end (posttest).

Team 1, 3, and 5 will export data as wide form and will not use `tidyr`.
