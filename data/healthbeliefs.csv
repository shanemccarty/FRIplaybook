Inequity or selfishness – If a decider chose an option that benefited themselves while offering very little to the other person, it might reflect a lack of empathy or fairness.

Manipulation of perception – The framing of options might influence how we perceive the deciders, potentially leading us to like or dislike them based on how choices were presented, not necessarily their true values.

Moral judgment under uncertainty – It’s risky to assess someone's morality or likeability based on isolated decisions, as it can oversimplify complex ethical thinking.","Generosity and fairness – I considered whether a decider chose to give more to the receiver, even though it didn’t benefit them personally, as a sign of kindness and concern for others' wellbeing.

Empathy – When a decider selected an option that seemed to acknowledge the other person's situation or shared more equally, it suggested they were thoughtful and considerate.

Social harmony – Actions that promote fairness and mutual benefit felt like they would lead to more trusting, positive relationships between people.

Altruism – Deciders who prioritized the good of the receiver, even in small ways, showed values that align with compassion and moral integrity.",3,4,3,2,3,4,4,3,4,3,2,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,4,3,3,3,5,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,3,4,3,4,2,4,4,4,2,4,5,3,5,3,6,4,3,5,2,5,3,2,5,4,4,5,2,4,6,5,4,4,4,"There was a time after a few nights of poor sleep—tossing and turning, waking up multiple times—when I felt noticeably off the next day. My patience was thin, and even small inconveniences felt overwhelming. I struggled to focus, my thoughts were scattered, and I felt unusually irritable and withdrawn. Emotionally, everything felt heavier, like I was more sensitive to stress and less resilient. It was a clear reminder of how much sleep impacts both mental clarity and emotional stability.",5,4,4,5,4,5,3,6,3,3,4,5,4,3,5,3,2,"Yes, I believe gun violence in the U.S. can be reduced, though it’s a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Effective strategies could include stronger background checks, better mental health support, community-based violence prevention programs, and closing loopholes in gun laws. Other countries have successfully reduced firearm violence through coordinated policy changes and cultural shifts—while the U.S. context is unique, progress is still possible with sustained commitment, bipartisan cooperation, and public support.","To me, ""safety"" means feeling secure—physically, emotionally, and mentally—without fear of harm or threat. It’s the assurance that your environment, relationships, and basic needs are stable and protected. Safety allows people to relax, trust, and thrive, whether that’s at home, in public, or within themselves.","Strong social connections – People look out for one another and feel a sense of belonging.

Effective local services – Accessible healthcare, education, and mental health support help prevent crises before they escalate.

Fair and responsive law enforcement – Officers who engage with the community respectfully and protect all residents equally.

Opportunities and equity – When people have access to jobs, housing, and resources, crime and desperation are less likely.

Community involvement – Residents actively participate in decision-making and problem-solving, which builds resilience and trust.",NA,"2,4",NA,8,"NO","I use social media to stay connected with friends and family, follow news and trends, and discover new ideas.

We relied on canned goods and occasional trips to farmers’ markets when they were available. As an adult, it’s easier with more resources, but time, cost, and availability still affect choices.","Cost – Fresh produce, lean meats, and whole foods are often more expensive than processed or fast food.

Location – Growing up in a neighborhood without nearby grocery stores (a food desert) made access difficult.

Transportation – Without a car, getting to stores with better options wasn’t always feasible.

Time – Busy schedules made it harder to cook healthy meals regularly.

Lack of education – Not always knowing what foods were nutritious or how to prepare them in affordable ways limited choices too.","There was a time in college when I had to visit a campus food pantry. I remember hesitating outside the door, worried someone I knew would see me. Inside, I felt self-conscious, like I didn’t belong—even though the volunteers were kind.

While the country has a deeply rooted gun culture and a high number of firearms, evidence-based strategies have shown promise in decreasing gun-related incidents.

Key Approaches to Reducing Gun Violence:

1. Implementing Comprehensive Gun Safety Laws: States like Colorado have enacted laws requiring background checks and safety courses for purchasing semiautomatic firearms, aiming to enhance public safety without infringing on Second Amendment rights 

2. Promoting Safe Firearm Storage: Encouraging or mandating secure storage of firearms can prevent unintentional shootings, especially among children and teens, and reduce the risk of gun thefts and suicides 

3. Supporting Community-Based Violence Intervention Programs: Initiatives that focus on de-escalating conflicts and providing support to individuals at high risk of violence have been effective in reducing gun violence in various communities 

4. Adopting a Public Health Approach: Treating gun violence as a public health crisis allows for the development of preventive measures, education, and community engagement to address the root causes of violence 

5. Implementing Red Flag Laws: These laws enable law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be a risk to themselves or others, preventing potential tragedies 

While challenges remain, the combination of legislative action, community engagement, and public health strategies offers a pathway to reducing gun violence in the United States.","To me, ""safety"" means feeling secure and protected from harm—physically, mentally, and emotionally. It’s the sense of being in an environment where risks are minimized, and there is a system of support in place to handle potential dangers. It encompasses things like personal well-being, the security of loved ones, and having access to resources that promote health and stability. Safety also involves having a sense of trust in your surroundings, whether it's at home, work, or in the community.","In my view, a safe community is built on a foundation of trust, mutual respect, and strong support systems. Key factors that contribute to creating a safe community include:

1. Effective Law Enforcement: A presence of well-trained, responsive law enforcement that upholds the law and engages with the community to build trust.
   
2. **Community Engagement**: Active participation from residents in problem-solving, organizing neighborhood events, and collaborating on safety initiatives. People knowing and supporting each other creates a sense of belonging.

3. **Social Support Systems**: Access to resources like mental health services, healthcare, education, and housing to ensure individuals' well-being. When people's needs are met, there's less strain on the community.

4. **Prevention Programs**: Initiatives that focus on violence prevention, substance abuse treatment, and youth mentorship can address root causes of crime and conflict before they escalate.

5. **Conflict Resolution**: Open communication and conflict resolution strategies to address disputes in peaceful, constructive ways.

6. **Environmental Design**: Well-maintained public spaces, lighting, and walkways that encourage safe and active use of the environment.

Ultimately, a safe community is one where people feel supported, valued, and empowered to contribute to the collective well-being.",1,"1,3,6,7",NA,25,"NO","My main reasons for using social media are:

1. **Staying Connected**: Social media helps me stay in touch with friends, family, and colleagues, even if they’re far away. It’s a great way to maintain relationships and keep up with important life events.

2. **Networking and Professional Growth**: It’s an effective platform for professional networking, keeping up with industry trends, and engaging with like-minded individuals or communities in my field.

3. **Sharing Knowledge and Insights**: I use social media to share useful information, whether it’s about technology, cybersecurity, or personal development. It’s also an opportunity to learn from others.

4. **Entertainment and Relaxation**: It provides a bit of fun and entertainment, whether through following interesting content, memes, or videos, helping me unwind during downtime.

5. **Advocacy and Awareness**: I like to use social media to raise awareness about important issues, whether it’s related to social justice, mental health, or other causes I care about.",5,2,4,4,6,6,5,3,5,3,3,5,4,NA,NA,3,5,5,0,2,3,3,2,"Accessing healthy and nutritious food has had its ups and downs in my experience. In the past, when I was living in a more rural area, it was difficult to consistently access fresh produce and other healthy foods. Local stores would often carry limited options, and it required planning ahead to buy healthier foods. I remember driving long distances just to visit farmers' markets or larger grocery stores with better selections, and sometimes, the produce wasn’t as fresh as I'd hoped.

In contrast, now that I'm in a more urban area, access to healthy food is much easier. I can find a variety of organic and fresh options at nearby supermarkets or even through delivery services. I’ve also seen the rise of local co-ops and farmers’ markets, which are a great way to access fresh, often locally-grown food. This shift has made it easier to prioritize a balanced diet, and I feel more energized as a result.

However, there are still challenges. For example, it can be expensive to buy high-quality, nutritious food consistently, and sometimes, the convenience of processed foods can be tempting, especially when life gets busy. Despite this, I’ve learned that taking the time to plan meals and make healthy choices has been worthwhile for both my physical and mental well-being.","Several factors have influenced my ability to access healthy and nutritious foods:

1. **Financial Constraints**: At times, the cost of fresh, organic, or high-quality foods can be prohibitive. For example, during periods when my budget was tight, I had to choose more affordable, processed options that were less nutritious but more within my financial reach.

2. **Limited Access to Stores**: In more rural or less-developed areas, there was a lack of supermarkets or grocery stores with a variety of healthy foods. The nearest store might only carry basic staples, and fresh produce options were often limited or overpriced, making it difficult to maintain a healthy diet.

3. **Time and Convenience**: When life gets busy, it’s tempting to opt for convenient, ready-to-eat meals or fast food, especially when meal prepping or going to the store takes time. This has occasionally led to choosing less healthy options because of time constraints or a lack of energy to cook.

4. **Lack of Knowledge or Guidance**: In some instances, I’ve struggled with knowing how to prepare certain nutritious foods or how to incorporate them into my diet in a practical way. This lack of knowledge sometimes made it harder to prioritize healthy eating.

5. **External Influences and Peer Pressure**: Social gatherings, work environments, or even family habits sometimes push me toward unhealthy choices. For example, when everyone around me is choosing takeout or processed snacks, it can be difficult to resist and stick to healthier options.

Though these circumstances have presented challenges, I’ve learned over time to find ways to work around them, such as meal prepping, making use of affordable yet healthy ingredients, and prioritizing where I spend my food budget.","NONE",3,4,6,6,4,2,5,4,3,"I believe food is considered ""unhealthy"" when it lacks essential nutrients or contains high levels of ingredients that can harm the body when consumed in excess. This includes:

1. **High Sugar Content**: Foods like soda, candy, and some breakfast cereals contain excessive added sugars, which can lead to weight gain, diabetes, and tooth decay.

2. **Excess Saturated or Trans Fats**: Fast food items like deep-fried chicken, fries, and certain baked goods (e.g., donuts, packaged pastries) often have unhealthy fats that raise bad cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease.

If more people knew how to use firearms, (in a controlled manner as safely and effectively as possible,) and owned one in most of the homes throughout the country then those who would be prone to violence would be less inclined and willing to do so considering the dangers to themselves.

I’d been juggling a lot—work deadlines, personal responsibilities, and trying to show up for people I care about. One night, I barely slept. My mind just wouldn’t shut off. I kept replaying conversations, worrying about the next day, tossing and turning. I might have gotten three or four hours of fragmented sleep.

The next morning, everything felt off.

Mentally, my thoughts were sluggish. I couldn’t focus, and tasks that normally felt simple took twice as long. I forgot small things, like where I put my keys or what I was supposed to say in a meeting.

Emotionally, I felt fragile. Little frustrations hit harder than usual—a snappy email, someone cutting in line, even just feeling behind. I teared up at a random commercial and then felt silly about it. My self-doubt was louder than usual, whispering things like you’re not doing enough or you’re letting people down.

Here’s why:

Why It’s Possible:
1. Other countries have done it
Many high-income countries that also have gun ownership (though usually more regulated) have far lower rates of gun violence. This suggests it’s not inevitable—it’s a matter of policy, culture, and support systems.

2. Evidence-based approaches exist
There are proven strategies that reduce gun violence:

Community-based violence interruption programs (like Cure Violence or Advance Peace) reduce shootings by intervening before retaliation happens.

Extreme risk protection orders (red flag laws) allow temporary removal of firearms from individuals in crisis.","“Safety,” to me, means more than just the absence of harm—it’s the presence of care, dignity, and freedom. It’s a condition where people feel protected not only physically, but emotionally, mentally, and culturally.

","In my view, a safe community is created when people, systems, and environments work together to foster well-being, dignity, and mutual care. It's not just about preventing harm—it's about building conditions where people can live fully and freely. Here’s what that looks like:

",1,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8",NA,4,"NO","Entertainment",5,4,6,6,7,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,4,6,5,4,5,6,0,3,2,3,3,"Maria grew up in a small urban neighborhood where fast food was everywhere, but fresh produce was not. The closest grocery store with fruits and vegetables was two bus rides away, and that was only if her mom got off work in time to go. Most days, meals came from the corner store—chips, ramen, soda, maybe a sandwich if they were lucky.

When Maria started school, she noticed she felt sluggish and had trouble focusing. Her teachers said she might have ADHD, but no one asked about what she was eating. It wasn’t until high school, when a community garden opened nearby, that things started to shift.

She started volunteering there—planting, watering, harvesting. For the first time, she tasted kale, tomatoes straight from the vine, strawberries that hadn’t traveled across the country. The garden wasn’t just food—it was community. She learned how to cook, too. Food became fuel, not just survival.

Now in her 20s, Maria lives in a different neighborhood and works as a youth mentor. She talks to her students about food justice and takes them to farmers markets when she can. But she still remembers the frustration of trying to eat well in a place that made it nearly impossible.

","That’s a powerful and deeply human question. While I don’t have personal needs or circumstances, I can speak from the perspective of people who’ve shared their stories—because many face real and layered barriers to accessing healthy food.

","There was a time when I had just lost my job, and money was tight. I swallowed my pride and went to a local food pantry for the first time. I thought I was prepared, but when I got there, something shifted.

As I stood in line, I kept my head down, hoping no one I knew would see me. I remember feeling this tight knot in my stomach—not from hunger, but from shame. I felt like I was doing something wrong, even though logically I knew I wasn’t. The volunteers were kind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched or silently judged.

Then, when it was my turn, I hesitated. I was overwhelmed by the canned goods and unfamiliar packaging. Someone behind me sighed loudly, and I felt like I was in the way. I rushed through it. I left with food, yes—but also with a heavy feeling, like I’d lost a piece of my dignity.

Later, I realized: the shame wasn’t mine to carry. The systems that make people feel small when they ask for help—that’s the real problem.

",5,6,6,4,7,6,7,4,5,"Lack Nutritional Value
These foods provide calories but little to no vitamins, minerals, fiber, or protein—often called ""empty calories.""

Examples:

Soda or sugary drinks: High in sugar, no fiber, spikes blood sugar.

Candy: Pure sugar with no nourishment.

White bread (highly processed): Stripped of fiber and nutrients during processing.

🧂 2. Are High in Added Sugar, Salt, or Saturated/Trans Fats
These ingredients can be harmful when eaten in excess, especially over time.

Examples:

Packaged snacks like chips or cheese puffs: Often high in salt and unhealthy fats.

Fast food burgers with fries: High in saturated fat, sodium, and sometimes sugar in sauces.

Baked goods like donuts or pastries: Often made with trans fats and added sugar.

🏭 3. Are Ultra-Processed
These foods are heavily modified with additives, preservatives, flavor enhancers, and artificial ingredients. They can interfere with hunger cues and gut health.

Examples:

Instant noodles with flavor packets.

Frozen “TV dinners” with long ingredient lists.

Processed meats like hot dogs or pepperoni.

⚠️ 4. Cause Imbalance Over Time
Even foods that aren’t “bad” in small amounts can become unhealthy if they dominate your diet and crowd out fresh, whole, nourishing foods.

But also—Context matters:
A slice of pizza now and then isn’t “bad.”

A sugary drink on a hot day doesn’t make you unhealthy.

","Several factors have limited my ability to access healthy and nutritious foods at different times in my life. One major factor was financial constraints—when money was tight, cheaper, processed foods were more accessible than fresh produce or organic items.

","There was a time when I had to visit a local food pantry during a tough financial period. I remember standing in line, feeling nervous and out of place.

High in Processed Sugars: Foods with excessive added sugars, such as sugary snacks, soft drinks, and candies, can contribute to weight gain, increased risk of diabetes, and other metabolic issues. For example, a can of soda typically contains around 39 grams of sugar, which can cause blood sugar spikes and lead to insulin resistance if consumed regularly.

In my past, I have been a victim of consumption and more often than not, I would opt for foods that were cheap and processed instead of fresh foods. Although, the study identified these needs, challenges such as time and unavailability of farmers’ markets were a hindrance. At present, I have more opportunities to be exposed but I am aware that this is a luxury. For instance, there was a time when I was trying to shop for vegetables in a food desert and could hardly find cheap and diverse produce, which drew my attention to these issues. Today, I give a lot of attention to meal planning and sourcing food locally and I know this is a process that involves much work. But the experience of previous shortcomings does help me promote the fight for the right of everyone to affordable food, as nutrition should not be a privilege but a necessity.","Lack of funds has remained the biggest issue, which has seen the adoption of constraints between cost and quality of the foods. Another factor that makes it difficult to prepare healthy meals is the limited time due to work or school schedules. Certain features, such as geographic location, are relevant in that there are “food deserts” that do not have access to fresh produce. Other barriers of transportation also limit the opportunity to visit different grocery stores or farmers’ markets located far away. The absence of educational programs related to nutrition affects people’s ability to make the right decisions. Also, due to culture or individual practice, people may limit the type of foods they take due to the limited exposure to the foods.

It has become clear that fast foods negatively affect health mainly because they are rich in sodium, saturated fats, and calories.

I struggled to focus, and even small tasks felt overwhelming. My patience was thinner than usual, and I found myself feeling more anxious and frustrated than normal.

I also noticed that my emotional responses were a bit more intense than usual—things that would normally roll off my back felt like bigger problems. It was like I had less emotional resilience, and I was much more sensitive to even the smallest setbacks.

Stores like Walmart, Meijer, and Elmer’s have consistently stocked fresh produce, whole grains, lean meats, and other healthy options, making it relatively easy for me to access what I need.

I remember times when I was focused on eating clean or following a specific diet, and I could always count on these stores to have what I needed, whether it was organic greens, low-sodium options, or gluten-free alternatives. Walmart, in particular, has always been reliable with both affordability and variety, which made healthy eating more accessible even during tighter financial times.

There were moments, though, when convenience foods were more tempting, especially when I was busier or dealing with stress. But knowing I had the option to walk into Meijer or Elmer’s and grab something fresh or prepped but still nutritious helped keep me on track. Having those choices available made a real difference in maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

So while I haven’t faced major challenges with food access, I understand how important it is to have reliable, nearby stores that make healthy options not just available, but affordable and easy to incorporate into daily life.","For the most part, I’ve been lucky to have access to healthy and nutritious food, thanks to nearby stores like Walmart, Meijer, and Elmer’s. But there have still been times when circumstances made it harder.

One of the biggest limitations has been financial. Even when healthy food is available, it’s not always the most affordable option, especially when you’re trying to stick to a budget. Fresh produce, lean meats, and organic products can add up quickly. There were times when I had to make choices based more on price than nutrition.

Time has also been a factor. During periods when I was working long hours or juggling a lot, convenience often won out. It’s not that I didn’t have access to healthy food, but preparing it felt overwhelming, especially when fast food or prepackaged meals were quicker.

Another subtle limitation has been motivation or mental energy. When I wasn’t feeling my best mentally or emotionally, even going to the store and making thoughtful food choices felt like a lot. In those moments, it didn’t matter how close the store was, it was my mindset was the barrier.

So while external access hasn’t been a major issue, personal circumstances like money, time, and emotional state have definitely influenced my ability to consistently choose and prepare healthy, nutritious foods.","NONE",1,0,0,7,7,2,3,2,0,"I believe food becomes “unhealthy” when it lacks nutritional value and contains ingredients that, especially when consumed regularly or in large amounts, negatively impact the body and mind. For example, foods that are heavily processed, loaded with added sugars, unhealthy fats, sodium, or artificial ingredients fall into this category for me.

Take something like soda, it’s high in sugar, has no nutrients, and can spike your blood sugar quickly, leading to energy crashes and long term health issues like diabetes if consumed too often. Another example would be fast food burgers or fries. While convenient and tasty, they’re often high in saturated fats, sodium, and preservatives, which can contribute to heart problems and weight gain when eaten frequently.

Unhealthy food to me also includes things like packaged snacks (chips, cookies, pastries) that are made to be addictive but don’t offer anything the body actually needs. They’re often full of empty calories—filling but not nourishing.

That said, I don’t think eating these foods once in a while is terrible, it’s more about the pattern and balance. If a person’s diet is made up mostly of these types of foods, that’s when it really starts to take a toll on health.",3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,80,10,6,3,1,30,25,20,15,10,5,8,4,3,9,7,6,11,1,2,10,12,25,70,65,5,3,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,3,5,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,7,3,3,3,3,2,56,5,5,1,"1","1,7",NA,2,0,1,1,23,"61564","49807",4,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"67fecebc796daedffc504e91","APPROVED","Not Applicable","2025-04-15T21:25:21.391000Z","2025-04-15T21:44:52.937000Z","2025-04-15T21:44:53.627000Z","",1172,"Manual Completion",742,"Independent","Female","Mixed","United States","United States","United States","English","No","Unemployed (and job seeking)"
