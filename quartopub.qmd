## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

-   A working Quarto project in Posit Cloud.

-   An active Quarto account linked to your school Google email.

    -   Sign in to [Quarto pub](https://quartopub.com/) with your school email account using google sign in.

-   Your`_quarto.yml` and `_publish.yml` files are in your project folder on Posit Cloud

    -   You can download these files from [306 Quant Track drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10AG6VkIKUBODfI4_p84Ozohu0dx3xLa3?usp=share_link)

## Prepare the `_publish.yml` File

In your `_publish.yml` file, add the following code (if not already present):

```{markdown}
- source: project
  quarto-pub:
    - id:                                  # leave the id blank
      url:                                 # leave the url blank
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not manually add or paste any token here.

Tokens are automatically handled by Quarto during the publishing process.

```{markdown}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Authorize Your Account

-   Under "Publish with account:" section choose "**Use another account...**" (see the @fig-chooseaccount below)

-   Next, the system will ask to authorize your account in order to publish to Quarto Pub. In the Authorize (Y/n) section, type "**Y**" for Yes. (see the @fig-authorize below)

-   In addition, you will get an url, click it and you will see your quarto account, click "ALLOW", this way you allow to publish into quarto. (see the @fig-linktoauthorization and @fig-authorizationpage below)

![Click authorization link](images/quartopub_4.png){#fig-linktoauthorization}

![Allow publishing access](images/quartopub-auth.png){#fig-authorizationpage}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Name Your Website

-   When prompted for "Site name: ", scroll down to "**Use another name...**" (see the @fig-sitename below)

-   Next, in "Publish with name" section, **enter a short name** for your report. (see the @fig-createname)

    -   different examples:

        -   e.g., zerosum

        -   e.g., safety-report

        -   e.g., avoider-report

    -   Your short name will be in the URL link when you publish (e.g., <https://zihanhei.quarto.pub/avoider-report/>)

![Select "Use another name"](images/quartopub_6.png){#fig-sitename}

![Create a name for your report](images/quartopub_7.png){#fig-createname}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4: Confirm and View Your Website

Once publishing completes successfully, you‚Äôll see a message in the terminal with a link to your new Quarto Pub website. Click the link to open your published report!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting and Tips

-   If you receive an authorization error, sign out of all Google accounts, then log in again with your school email.

-   To update your site later, simply run:

    ```{markdown}
    quarto publish quarto-pub 
    ```

-   Your `_publish.yml` should **never contain tokens or IDs** you did not generate yourself.

-   To delete a published site, go to your [Quarto Pub dashboard](https://quartopub.com/) and remove it manually.
