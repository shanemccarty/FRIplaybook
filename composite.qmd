title: "Creating Composite Scores from Survey Scales"
author: "Claude.ai"
abstract: |
  This chapter teaches students how to create composite scores from multi-item survey scales. Students learn to check whether items on a scale reliably measure the same construct using Cronbach's alpha, and then calculate an average score across all items. The chapter uses a straightforward approach where composite scores are only calculated for participants who answered all items on the scale, ensuring everyone's score has the same meaning. Through a practical example with sleep behavior data, students learn the essential steps: select items, check reliability, remove incomplete cases, and calculate mean scores. This skill is fundamental when working with validated scales in public health surveys.
