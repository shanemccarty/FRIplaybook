A Quarto Markdown Document (`.qmd`) integrates the R programming language with markdown language into a single document that can include a mix of code and written content. We use `report.qmd` and other `.qmd` files to write a reproducible manuscript using written text within embedded code chunks.\n\n### Example Code Chunk\n\nBelow is an example from the @ggplot2.qmd chapter of an informative `label` for your code chunk and a very detailed figure caption ( `fig-cap`). Also, notice that all code chunk options start with `#|` and use a `:`.\n\nFor more examples, see @ggplot2.qmd.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| echo: fenced\n#| eval: false\n```\n\n### Template Code Chunk\n\n#### Label for All Code Chunks\n\nYour `#| label:` should be lowercase with dashs between words to create a complete object with no spaces, such as import-data-csv or import-data-xlsx.\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: import-data-xlsx\n\n```\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nEvery code chunk must have a `#| label:` at the start of the chunk.\n:::\n\n#### Figure Caption (Fig-Cap) for Plot Code Chunks\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: provide a detailed figure caption\n\n```\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nEvery plot should include a detailed figure caption using `#| fig-cap:`\n:::\n\n#### Alternative Text for Figures and Images (Fig-Alt) {#alt-text}\n\nEvery image and figure/plot/graph/table should be accessible to people with blindness or low vision. By providing alt text, you are explaining the figure and image with enough detail for a screen reader. This is a requirement of Binghamton University based on federal law.\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: provide a detailed figure caption\n#| fig-alt: provide info for accessiblity\n```\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nEvery figure and image should include alternative text using `#| fig-alt:`\n:::\n\nFor more information on how improve the accessiblity of an image, see [figures-alt-text on Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#alt-text) to use alt text to increase accessiblity.\n\n#### Provide Sources for ALL Code Chunks\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nAt the end of every code chunk, include the source of the code chunk so that others can replicate your work. You should use a pseudo APA citation format with (author, year) and website link (if possible).\n:::\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n\n#source example 1: The FRI Playbook (McCarty, 2025)   \n#source example 2: Writing Reproducible Results (Hei, 2025)   \n#source example 3: Quarto guide markdown basics: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\n## \"#\\|\" vs. \"\\#\"\n\nThe format is different for the code chunk options that use `#|` (e.g., `#| label:`) vs. sourcing using `#` to comment (e.g., `#source:`). The #source will be at the bottom of your code chunk.\n:::\n\n#### Provide Explanation for ALL Code Chunks\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nYou will explain the code chunk in your own words using `#explanation:` at the bottom of your code chunk.\n:::\n\n##### Example of Non-Figure Code Chunk\n\nAll of your R code chunks for non-figures should follow this format:\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: import-data-csv-insurance\n\ninsurance <- read.csv(\"data/insurance.csv\")\n\n#source: (Wickham et al., 2023) https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-import.html#practical-advice\n#explanation: importing the insurance data from a comma-separated values (CSV) based on import code from R4DS book \n\n```\n\n##### Example of Figure Code Chunk\n\nAll of your R code chunks for figures should follow this format:\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| fig-alt: the scatterplot shows BMI on the x axis and insurance charges on the y axis with the grouping variable of smoker. The smokers are denoted in teal and the non-smokers are in red. The smokers and non-smokers have a different slope, showing a different relationship/slope for BMI and insurance chargers based on smoker status.\n\nggplot(data = insurance,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = bmi,\n         y = charges,\n         color = smoker)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n  \n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n\n```\n\n#### Setting library code chunk\n\nBy setting the `#| output:` to `false`, none of the output from running the code will show up. Only the code chunk for loading the library has `#| output: false`. The output is \"attaching package (`readxl`), which is not necessary for our report. In almost all cases, your code chunk will NOT include the `output` option. If you do include it, it will mostly be set to `true` in order for you to output results, a plot, etc.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-library-readxl\n#| echo: fenced\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n```\n\n#### Code Chunk Options\n\nFor more information on code chunks, see [code chunk options](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#chunk-options).\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: example-with-options\n#| eval: true          # Whether to execute the code\n#| output: true        # Whether to display output\n#| warning: false      # Hide warnings\n#| message: false      # Hide messages\n#| error: false        # Hide errors\n#| fig-cap: \"Caption\"  # Figure caption\n#| fig-width: 8        # Figure width in inches\n#| fig-height: 6       # Figure height in inches\n\n# Your code here below these code chunk options\n\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: callout-tip\n## ðŸ“– `quarto` resources\n\n-   [Primary website](https://quarto.org)\n-   [R4DS Book Chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html)\n-   [Youtube: Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew)\n-   [Youtube: Quarto for Academics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbAAmrB0luA)\n-   [Posit Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/quarto.html)\n-   [PDF Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/quarto.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Required\n\nYour *R&D Report* and *R&D Team Manuscript* will be a `.qmd` file with code chunks containing: label, fig-cap, fig-alt, source information, and explanation.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## updated 10/18/2025\n:::\n\nIn your Posit Cloud window browser, you should see the *source* and *visual* editor options in the top left corner of your screen.

documents (.qmd)\nfor reproducible research. Researchers learn to set up new Quarto documents, configure metadata\nusing YAML headers, and write formatted text using markdown syntax. The chapter demonstrates\nproper code chunk structure with descriptive labels, detailed figure captions, and execution\noptions. Rtudents explore essential practices including file naming conventions, environment\nmanagement, and documentation through code sources and explanations. By the end of this\nchapter, researchers will understand how to create professional, well-documented Quarto reports\nthat integrate narrative text with embedded R code, following reproducible research standards\nfor public health manuscripts.\n","keywords":["quarto","YAML","markdown","code chunks","reproducible research","file management"],"date":"10.18.2025","date-format":"MM.DD.YYYY","editor":"visual"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}},"projectFormats":["html"]}
