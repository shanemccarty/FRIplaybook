It is important to clear all objects from your environment before beginning your next assignment. Also, this code is important to use when you want to double check that your `.qmd` document will render correctly. You can clear all of the objects and then run your entire .qmd document to check for errors.\n\n```{r}\n# Remove all objects from the global environment\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n\nFor your draft and final team MMR manuscript, you should: - pick one quantitative team member to store the team files in their posit cloud project - rename this specific posit cloud project from #1: Vivian -\\> #1: Vivian & Team (to notify me where to look for your team's MMR work) - create a `team_RD.qmd` file - create a `team_final.qmd` file\n\n## YAML\n\nYAML (human-readable data serialization language) has a simple syntax, which is a structured way to organize information (aka metadata), such as title, author, date, and format output (HTML vs. PDF).\n\n::: callout-important\n### Requirement\n\nUse this YAML format at the top of ALL Quarto markdown document files (`.qmd`).\n:::\n\n```{YAML}\n---\n\ntitle: \"name your final report here\"\nauthor: \"put your full name here\"\ndate: \"3/22/2023\"\nabstract: |\n    TBD goes here\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 4\n    code-fold: true\n    \n---\n```\n\nFor more information, see [YAML](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html).\n\n## Markdown\n\nYou will write in the English language with [markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) language to format your quarto report.\n\n```{markdown}\nThis is a language called markdown. It is very simple. You can use\n*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics*** to produce:\n```\n\n-   *italics*\n-   **bold**\n-   ***bold italics***\n\n### Verbatim Code\n\nYou can use a backtick to denote code or the name of a variable by placing a word within \\`\\`. For example, if I put EFFICACY between \\`\\` then it returns `EFFICACY` . This will be important for naming variables in your report.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nUse \\` \\` between CAPITALIZED variable names in your report if you are referring to the measured variable. The use of backticks is NOT appropriate in your introduction and discussion sections, but backticks should be used in your methods and results sections.\n:::\n\n## Code Chunks\n\nA traditional R script (`.R`) involves code throughout the entire script. A Quarto Markdown Document (`.qmd`) integrates the R programming language with markdown language into a single document that can include a mix of code and written content. We use `report.qmd` and other `.qmd` files to write a reproducible manuscript using written text within embedded code chunks.\n\n### Example Code Chunk\n\nBelow is an example from the @ggplot2.qmd chapter of an informative `label` for your code chunk and a very detailed figure caption ( `fig-cap`). Also, notice that all code chunk options start with `#|` and use a `:`.\n\nFor more examples, see @ggplot2.qmd.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| echo: fenced\n#| eval: false\n```\n\n### Template Code Chunk\n\n#### Label for All Code Chunks\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nEvery code chunk must have a `#| label:` at the start of the chunk.\n:::\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: this is a label that you will revise\n\n```\n\nYour `#| label:` should be lowercase with dashs between words to create a complete object with no spaces, such as import-data-csv or import-data-xlsx.\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: import-data-xlsx\n\n```\n\n#### Figure Caption (Fig-Cap) for Plot Code Chunks\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nEvery plot should include a detailed figure caption using `#| fig-cap:`\n:::\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: you need to revise this with detailed figure caption\n\n```\n\n#### Provide Sources for ALL Code Chunks\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nAt the end of every code chunk, include the source of the code chunk so that others can replicate your work. You should use a pseudo APA citation format with (author, year) and website link (if possible).\n:::\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: you-need-to-revise-this\n#| fig-cap: you need to revise this with detailed figure caption\n\n#source example 1: The FRI Playbook (McCarty, 2025)   \n#source example 2: Write Functions (Hei, 2025)   \n#source example 3: Quarto guide markdown basics: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n```\n\nNotice that the format is different. The `#source:` NOT be in the prior `#|` format you used for the code chunks at the topic. The #source will be at the bottom of your code chunk.\n\n#### Provide Explanation for ALL Code Chunks\n\n::: callout-important\n## Requirement\n\nYou will explain the code chunk in your own words using `#explanation:` at the bottom of your code chunk.\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot-BMI-insurance\n#| fig-cap: A scatterplot depicting the relationship between body mass index and insurance charges with a line of best fit to demonstrate the liner relationship between the two variables\n#| echo: fenced\n#| eval: false\n\nggplot(data = insurance, mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n#source: Introduction to ggplot2 (Silhavy & McCarty, 2025)\n#explanation: the insurance data is being used with BMI for the x variable and insurance charges for the year variable. geom_point is used for scatterplots. geom_smooth with lm adds a linear model on top of the datapoint to show the association between BMI and insurance charges\n\n```\n\n#### Code Chunk Options\n\nFor more information on code chunks, see [code chunk options](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#chunk-options).\n\n```{r}\n#| label: example-with-options\n#| eval: true          # Whether to execute the code\n#| echo: fenced        # for teaching -- this shows the code chunk options to you\n#| output: true        # Whether to display output\n#| warning: false      # Hide warnings\n#| message: false      # Hide messages\n#| error: false        # Hide errors\n#| fig-cap: \"Caption\"  # Figure caption\n#| fig-width: 8        # Figure width in inches\n#| fig-height: 6       # Figure height in inches\n\n# Your code here below these code chunk options\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: callout-tip\n## ðŸ“– `quarto` resources\n\n-   [Primary website](https://quarto.org)\n-   [R4DS Book Chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html)\n-   [Youtube: Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew)\n-   [Youtube: Quarto for Academics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbAAmrB0luA)\n-   [Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/quarto.pdf)\n-   [Posit website](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/quarto.html)\n:::\n\nIn your Posit Cloud window browser, you should see the *source* and *visual* editor options in the top left corner of your screen.
