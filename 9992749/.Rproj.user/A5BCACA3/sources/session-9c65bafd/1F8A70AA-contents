# Superpower Presentation

Add your **name** here

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is your superpower? {auto-animate="true"}

Add a short description of what your superpower does, and if applicable, add a small code snippet below:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Sample dataset: mtcars
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "MPG vs. Weight of Cars",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Why is your superpower important? {auto-animate="true"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Demonstrate more code and an output, perhaps with an image.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#example code; this is meant to fill the column
#might be good to put an image/executed code here
```

## How can your superpower help the class? {auto-animate="true"}

-   Examples
    -   Application 1
    -   Application 2
        -   sub-item 1

## What is your plan? {auto-animate="true"}

How will you demonstrate to the class how to use this library?

```{r}
#simple application of code to give the class an idea of the basics
```

## Extra slides for teaching the superpower {auto-animate="true"}

Filler

## Extra slide 2

Filler; example of focusing on certain lines of code

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4|6"
h_sum_while <- function(x, n) {
  result <- 1
  i <- 1
  while (i <= n) {
    result <- result + x^i
    i <- i + 1
  }
  return(result)
}
```
