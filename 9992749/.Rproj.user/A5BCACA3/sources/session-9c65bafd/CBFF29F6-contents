format: html
editor: visual
---

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. This template uses Quarto to demonstrate the color palettes of R's Viridis package in three mediums:

-   as an HTML, PDF, or Word document in `colors_document.qmd`
-   as a slide deck in `colors_presentation.qmd`
-   as a web page with interactive Shiny components in `colors_app.qmd`

# Previewing

## To preview the document

1.  Open the file `colors_document.qmd`.
2.  Then click the Render button that will appear above the opened file. This will display the document as an HTML file.
3.  To display the document as a pdf or MS Word file, edit line 5 to one of the below, then click Render:
    a.  PDF - `format: pdf`
    b.  Word - `format: cox`

## To preview the presentation

1.  Open the file `colors_presentation.qmd`.
2.  Then click the Render button that will appear above the opened file. This will display the document as a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) HTML slide deck, which can be presented with any web browser.
3.  To display the presentation as a beamer (PDF) or MS PowerPoint slide deck, edit line 5 to one of the below, then click Render:
    a.  Beamer (PDF) - `format: beamer`
    b.  PowerPoint - `format: pptx`

## To preview the interactive document with Shiny components

1.  Open the file `colors_app.qmd`.
2.  Then click the Run Document button that will appear above the opened file. Because the file contains the YAML line `server: shiny`, Quarto will run the file as an interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app.

# Publishing

## To publish these documents to Posit Cloud

1.  Open the document, or its rendered output.
2.  Click the blue publish icon that will appear to the far right above the document.
3.  Complete and submit the dialog that appears.

Your published output will appear in another browser tab, where you can interact with it.

It will also get added as a new content item to Your Workspace. You can see it listed there by clicking the Your Workspace link in the header.
